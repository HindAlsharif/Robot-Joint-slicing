# Robot-Joint-slicing

# Overview
This project involves preparing a 3D model of a robotic joint for 3D printing. The model is converted to STL format and opened in a slicer (Ankermake Studio) to set the printing parameters .

# Details
- STL Conversion: Convert the robotic joint model to STL format.  
- Slicing Setup: Open the STL in a slicer and set print settings.  
- Material Choice:  PETG for printing material.  
- Documentation: Include screenshots of the slicer settings.  

# Recommended Material
Choosing PETG as a 3D printing material because it is:

1. Strong  
   - PETG is tough and flexible.  
   - Good for parts that face repeated force or movement.  

2. Better Heat Resistance  
   - Can handle heat up to ~70–80°C.  
   - Useful if the joint is near warm areas or servo motors.  

3. Good Wear Resistance   
   - PETG is smooth and less brittle, so moving parts slide better.  

4. Resistant to Chemicals  
   - Works well in different environments without damage from water or oils.  

5. Balanced Strength and Flexibility  
   - Strong but slightly flexible to avoid breaking.  

# Technologies Used
- Ankermake Studio 
- Onshare 
- STL 3D model  

# Usage
1. Convert the robotic joint model to STL format.  
2. Open the STL file in a slicer (e.g., Ankermake Studio).  
3. Set the print parameters (layer height, infill, supports, etc.).  
4. Slice the model.
